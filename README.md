# kevin-weis-springboard

This is a repository for my mini-projects that I completed as part of Springboard's Data Science career track. These mini-projects demonstrate vital data science skills such as working with APIs, understanding fundamental statistics, and using SQL to extract actionable insights. In alphabetical order, the mini-projects in this repository are:

1. API data wrangling
  
In this project, I used the Python Standard Library and requests package to perform ETL on data obtained from an API. Information was retrived from Quandl, a "marketplace for financial, economic, and alternative data" to perform analysis on the Frankfurt stock exchange. 
  
2. Bayesian Optimization Case Study

In this project, I used the Bayesian Optimization library to perform hyperparameter tuning. A Light GBM model was trained to predict flight delays and optimized using a Bayesian optimizer function created in the exercise.  

3. Case Study: Apps 

This case study served as an introduction to working within a Jupyter notebook to follow a standard data science pipeline to answer the question of whether Apple store apps received better reviews than Google play apps. 

4. Clustering Case Study: Customer Segmentation

This case study used K-Means clustering to perform customer segmentation. It includes ETL, EDA, model creation, and model visualization. 

5. Cosine Similarity Case Study

This case study served to demonstrate the utility of cosine similarity measures by using it to compare numeric data within a plane and with a text dataset for string matching. Cosine similarities were calculated using the cosine_similarity function from sklearn.metrics.pairwise 

6. Cowboy Cigarettes Case Study

This case study created an ARIMA model to predict sales of cigarettes during a time period for which there was no historical data, essentially using the model to fill in the gap of data. In this notebook, I performed ETL, EDA, model creation, and model evaluation. 

7. Decision Tree Case Study: Specialty Coffee

This case study created a decision tree to predict how many units of specialty coffee will be purchased by a coffee company's most loyal customers. This notebook follows the typical data science pipeline, including ETL, EDA, Modeling, and evaluation. 

8. Euclidean and Manhattan Distances

This mini-project demonsntrates the difference between Euclidean and Manhattan distance. The purpose was to build an understanding of the effects of using difference distance measures in order to better understand algorithms that use them, such as Principal Components Analysis.

9. Frequentist Inference Case Study

This case study applied concepts associated with Frequentist Inferenc using Python. In this notebook, I practiced writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: the z-statistic, the t-statistic, the difference and relationship between the z-statistic and t-statistic, the Central Limit Theorem (including its assumptions and consequences), how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample, the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic (particularly for the mean), and how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval. 

10. Gradient Boosting Case Study

This case study demonstrates the utility of gradient boosting by working through a simple example using Decision Trees as the base predictors on the Titanic dataset. 
  
11. GridSearch KNN Case Study: 

This case study was all about using grid searches to identify the optimal parameters for a machine learning algorithm. It used the Pima Indian diabetes dataset from Kaggle, and used a KNN algorithm. This notebook contains ETL, EDA, model creation, and evaluation. 
    
12. Random Forest case Study

This case study used Random Forests to predict patient 'state' (released, isolated, decseased) on a dataset of South Korean coronavirus cases. 
  
13. Regression Case Study: the Red Wine Dataset

This case study used exploratory data analysis and a simple linear regression to predict alcohol levels in wine. It follwed a typical data science pipeline, with ETL, EDA, Modeling, and Evaluation. It made four models: a linear regression, an ordinary least square, a multiple linear regression, and another multiple linear regression that removed highly correlated variables. 

14. SQL Mini Project

This project demonstrated how to use SQL both in a web-interface (PHPMyAdmin) and in a Jupyter notebook via a Python connection.
